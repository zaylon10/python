#  22.1 LAB: Convert to seconds
# Write a program that reads in hours, minutes, and seconds as input, and outputs the time in seconds only.
# Ex: If the input is:
# 1
# 6
# 40


# where 1 is the number of hours, 6 is the number of minutes, and 40 is the number of seconds, the output is:
# Seconds: 4000
hours = 1

print('hours *60 * 60')
